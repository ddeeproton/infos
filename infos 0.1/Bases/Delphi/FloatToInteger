How to convert a double or real to 
an integer? [float / cast]

---

Steps: Overview:

 1. -To convert a double to an integer
     use any round off function.

     e.g.

      Ceil()

      Floor()

      Round()

      Trunc()

     1. use Ceil() to round off

        Call Ceil to obtain the lowest integer greater than or equal to
        X.

        The absolute value of X must be less than MaxInt.

         Ceil( -2.8 ) = -2

         Ceil( 2.8 ) = 3

         Ceil( -1.0 ) = -1

     2. use Floor() to round off

        Call Floor to obtain the highest integer less than or equal to
        X.

        e.g.

         Floor(-2.8) = -3

         Floor(2.8) = 2

         Floor(-1.0) = -1

     3. use Round() to round off

        That is the value of X rounded to the nearest whole number.

        1. it rounds off to the lower nearest integer if
           the decimal part is smaller than 0.5

            e.g. Round( 3.1898098454 ) becomes 3

        2. If X is exactly halfway between two whole numbers, the 
result
           is always the even number.

            This method of rounding is often called
            "Banker's Rounding".

             e.g. Round( 3.5 ) becomes the even integer,
                  thus 4

             e.g. Round( 2.5 ) becomes the even integer,
                  thus 2

        3. It rounds off to the higher nearest integer if
           the decimal part is greater than 0.5

            e.g. Round( 3.9898098454 ) becomes 4

     4. use Trunc() to round off

        It takes of the
        part after the decimal point,
        so rounding off to the lower
        nearest integer.

        e.g. Trunc( 3.9898098454 ) = 3

        e.g. Trunc( 1.4 ) = 1

        e.g. Trunc( 1.5 ) = 1

        e.g. Trunc( -1.4 ) = -1

        e.g. Trunc( -1.5 ) = -1
